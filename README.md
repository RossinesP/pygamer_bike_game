# Context
The game runs on the Py Gamer using CircuitPython (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242) connected to a home bike, the Sportstech X100-B.
You can probably use any other home bike, as long as uses a reed switch to read the speed and you can wire that reed switch to your Py Gamer.
The X100-B provides a convenient female jack connector directly wired to the reed, so it was easy to connect it.
